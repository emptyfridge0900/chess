### Objective
To check how much I understand rust by doing a side project using what I learned in the book.


This chess project was not implemented using [bitboard](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards). Moves of Pieces were implemented using [Trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html), and the Board used a 64-size array. This is a Console program and White takes the turn first, followed by Black.

1. The board size is 8x8
2. [Implement En Passant](https://www.chess.com/terms/en-passant)
3. [Implement Promotion/underpromotion](https://www.chess.com/terms/pawn-promotion)
4. [Implement Castling](https://www.chess.com/terms/castling-chess)
5. [Notation & move](https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-notation)
6. Optional implementation [Checkmate](https://www.chess.com/terms/checkmate-chess)
